// Package leiden provides a pure-Go implementation of the Leiden algorithm for
// community detection in weighted, undirected graphs.
//
// The Leiden algorithm (Traag, Waltman, van Eck, 2019) refines the Louvain
// method to guarantee well-connected communities. This package targets the
// same primitives as the reference implementation in networkanalysis-java
// (CWTS) and leidenalg (Python), while remaining idiomatic Go with zero
// external dependencies.
//
// The core data structures are:
//
//   - [Edge]: an undirected, weighted edge used as input.
//   - [CompactNetwork]: an immutable CSR-style representation of the graph.
//   - [Clustering]: a partition of nodes into clusters.
//
// Higher-level entry points (the algorithm itself, options, results) are
// introduced in later milestones and are not part of this milestone.
